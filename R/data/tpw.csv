10a. READ: Think of appearance number 1, was it for a hearing, continuance or court monitoring?

 

Assessor Notes: 

(1) A hearing is when you have to go before a judge so that s/he can decide what is going to happen to you. For example deciding where you are going to live, if you are going to be in detention or do community service, or if the charges against you will be dropped. By the end of the hearing you will know what the judge wants you to do or not do and who is going to take care of you.

(2) A continuance is when you go to court but then you find out that the lawyers or caseworkers need more time to talk about your case. They usually give you another date to come back again when they are ready to decide what is going to happen. 

(3) Court Monitoring is when you have to check in with the judge so s/he can see how you are doing. S/he will ask you some questions to see if you have been doing what you are supposed to or to see how things are going in the place you are living. S/he may also check in with your caseworker, therapist, or probation officer to see if you are doing okay.","10b.
